# Purpose

To provide a reusable resource for myself as well as a resource for any 
developer to start a gatsby site, in this case, a blog

<strong>Note: </strong>I have no experience with using Gatsby or React prior to
starting this project, so best practices may not be used.

## Getting Started

### Ensure NPM / NodeJS are installed
On my machine I have Node v11.15.0 & NPM v6.7.0 installed

```bash
node --version
# v11.15.0
# Your node version may be different, 
# According to Gatsby, recommended versio is Node8 (v8.x.x) and above

npm --version
# v6.7.0
```

If you don't have NodeJS installed, checkout [NodeJS Homepage](https://nodejs.org/en)
### Ensure you have git installed

```git
git --version
# git version 2.20.1
```

If you don't have git installed, check out [Installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


### Setting up Dev environment

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```
